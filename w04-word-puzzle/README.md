# Week 4 – Word Puzzle Game (Python)

This project is part of my **Software Development Bachelor program at BYU–Idaho**.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this assignment, I built an interactive word puzzle game inspired by Wordle.  
The program repeatedly prompts the user to guess a secret word and provides dynamic hints until the correct word is found.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- Loops and iteration (`while` loops)
- Input validation
- Conditional logic
- String comparison and indexing
- State tracking (guess counter)
- Incremental software development

## 🎯 How the Game Works
- The program stores a hidden secret word.
- The user makes guesses until the word is correct.
- If the guess length is incorrect, the program displays an error message.
- If the guess length is correct, a hint is generated:
  - `_` → letter not present in the word
  - lowercase → letter present but in the wrong position
  - UPPERCASE → letter in the correct position
- The game ends when the user guesses correctly and displays the total number of guesses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of how loops and conditional logic work together to create interactive and responsive programs—core skills for real-world software engineering.
